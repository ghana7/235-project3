            <h3>Process:</h3>
            <h4>Beginnings</h4>
            <p>Our design process began with a discussion in Discord about what type of game we wanted to make. After
                discussing the idea of an idle game, we randomly generated a topic and decided to go with a farming idle
                game.</p>
            <h4>Design choices</h4>
            <p>The structure of the website was taken from Jimmie's project 1, with colors, fonts, and overall visual
                style changed to fit the new theme. We went with a brown and off-white color scheme, as is typical in
                farming-related media, and added some more vibrant accent colors for links.
            </p>
            <h4>Final polishes</h4>
            <p>I added some slight gradients on headings and menu bars for
                some added flair, made sure the page was responsive, and
                added in some images I made that will probably end up
                being assets for the game.
            </p>
