            <h3> High Concept</h3>

            <h4>Original Idea:</h4>
            <p>An idle clicker game based around plants.</p>

            <h4>Then slightly refined:</h4>
            <p>An incremental farming game where you grow and combine crops to make profits.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Genre</h3>
            <h4>Incremental Game / Farming Sim</h4>

            <p>At its core, this game is an incremental game, which means it starts with small, simple mechanics, and
                grows to become more complex and interesting.</p>
            <p>The growth will come through different farming mechanics, crop combinations, and economic strategies.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Platform</h3>

            <h4>Web-based game</h4>

            <p>This game will be built for web play, using PixiJS.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Story</h3>
            <p>While wandering through the forests, you run into an abandoned farm with pictures of some weird-looking
                crops on its signposts. You only see a few seeds, though, and decide to begin to learn plant
                hybridization to discover the secrets of the farm (and make a profit).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3> Aesthetics</h3>
            <p>The graphics style will be old-timey, like an old, dirty farm. Sprites for plants, seeds, and other
                various objects will be pixel graphics, in a similar old, faded style.</p>

            <h3> Gameplay</h3>

            <h4> Mechanics</h4>
            <p>The player has a field of crops that grow over time. As crops are harvested, they can either be sold for
                money or combined to create new crops. Money can be spent on various upgrades, such as field
                explansions, fertilizer, or machines that will help the player farm more efficiently.</p>

            <h4> Control</h4>
            <p>Most action, such as planting crops and purchasing, will happen with the mouse,
                but hotkeys could be a potential addition to enhance the user experience</p>

            <h4> Onboarding</h4>
            <p>Since this is an incremental game, the entire game is just a long onboarding process. The player will
                start with only a few very cheap, fast growing crops. They will quickly be able to experiment with
                hybrids of these crops and the purchase of upgrades, all tempered by their money income, which will
                limit the overwhelming nature of endless possibilites.</p>

            <h4> Player learning</h4>
            <p>Players will improve at the game by recognizing new ways to combine crops, knowing which upgrades to buy,
                and becoming more efficient at managing resources.</p>
